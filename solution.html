    <h3 class="h3">Positive Parenting is the key and it starts with:</h3>
        <ul class="ul1">
            <li><b>Introspection</b><br>
                After a long day, review your interactions with your child. Have these interactions been one-sided or does your child have the right to disagree? 
                Has your own behavior been understanding and inspiring?
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Encourage</b>
                Encouragement, coming from parents, can be a child’s stepping stone to success. You are a key player in your child’s life and shall be the one your child will depend on to learn confidence, hard work and excellence. 
                It is also your responsibility to teach your child to accept failure without losing heart. Failure is a cue to seek opportunity and not an occasion for mourning.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Interact</b>
                Some of the best times you are likely to spend with your child are those when you are playing, laughing and participating in fun or leisure activities. 
                Make these times an opportunity to build camaraderie and friendship.
                Any advice that you shall then have will not sound like a commandment and will help strengthen your child’s personality.
            </li>
        </ul>
    <h3 class="h3">Dealing with parental pressure as children, we should:</h3>
        <ul class="ul1">
            <li><b>Remain Calm.</b>
                Even if it is the tenth time this hour that your mother has told you to stop slouching/watch your mouth/put away your laundry, remain calm. Getting into a screaming match may help you blow of some steam, but if you want your parents to listen to what you have to say, make sure that you say it in a reasonable tone. 
                Remaining calm and speaking seriously will convey to your parents that you:
                    <ul>
                        <li class="a">Have given your topic serious thought</li>
                        <li class="a">Can speak about your topic in a reasonable manner</li>
                        <li class="a">Are mature enough to have a discussion, not an argument</li>
                        <li class="a">Will be willing to listen to their opinions during this discussion</li>
                    </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Know Your Argument.</b>
                Of course by the time your parents realise that you are willing to have a discussion with them, you really must be ready to have this discussion. 
                Make sure that you know your argument and can present it in a convincing manner.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Look into the Brighter Side.</b>
                Turning those set up high expectations into a positive way, maybe expectations that you will do well in school, 
                can help you and will serve as an encouragement. Be positive!
