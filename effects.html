            <h1 class="h1">How Putting Too Much Pressure on Children Is Harming Them</h1>
            <br>
            <p class="p">While high expectations can be healthy, placing constant pressure on children can be harmful. 
            When kids feel like each homework assignment is going to make or break their future or that each soccer game 
            could determine if they get a college scholarship, that pressure will have negative consequences.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Here are just a few of the dangers kids may experience when parents put them under enormous amounts of pressure:</b> 
            </p>
                <ol class="ol">
                    <br>
                        <li><b>Higher rates of mental illness.</b> Kids who feel like they’re under constant pressure may experience constant anxiety. High amounts of stress can 
                        also place children at a greater risk of developing depression or other mental health issues.</li>
                    <br>
                        <li> <b>Increased risk of suicide.</b> Studies have found a link between suicidal ideation and parental pressure. 
                        Approximately one in five of the students evaluated had contemplated suicide due to the enormous pressure from parents to produce exceptional grades.
                        </li>
                    <br>
                        <li>
                            <b>Self-esteem problems.</b>  Pushing kids to excel can damage their self-esteem. The constant stress to perform interferes with children’s 
                            identity formation and causes them to feel like they’re not good enough.
                        </li>
                    <br>
                        <li>
                             <b>Sleep deprivation.</b> Kids who feel constant pressure to do well in school may stay up late studying and as a result, 
                            they may struggle to get enough sleep.
                        </li>
                    <br>
                        <li>
                            <b>Higher risk of injuries.</b> Athletes who feel a lot of pressure may continue to participate in sports despite injuries. 
                            Ignoring pain or returning to a sport before an injury has healed could lead to permanent damage.
                        </li>
                    <br>
                        <li>
                            <b>Increased likelihood of cheating.</b> When the focus is on achievement—rather than learning—kids are more likely to cheat. Whether it’s a young child catching a glimpse of his neighbor’s answer on a test, or a college student paying someone to write a term paper, 
                            cheating is common among kids who feel pressure to perform well.
                        </li>
                    <br>
                        <li>
                            <b>Refusing to participate.</b> When kids feel the goal is to always “be the best,” they’re not likely to participate when they aren’t likely to shine. A child who isn’t the fastest runner may quit playing soccer and a child who isn’t the best singer in the group may quit choir. 
                            Unfortunately, that means kids won’t take opportunities to sharpen their skills.
