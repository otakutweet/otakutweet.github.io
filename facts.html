                <h1>PARENTAL PRESSURE</h1>
                <h3>Peer pressure is one thing but parent pressure is another. It has been around forever, but hasn't been as easily recognised. 
                    Parent pressure is in schools, sports, arts and careers.</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Parent pressure is when a parent puts too much strain on their child to force them to exceed. The pressure is normally to be the best in the chosen field, even one that they used to succeed at and now can't. 
                The pressure can come from any type of family and can be pressure to be the best in the grade in regards to school and receive the highest marks. Or to score the most points or goals in the sporting match and win the best on ground. 
                It would be to play the best music or paint the award-winning picture; or the pressure could be to succeed in the career field and receive the same promotions and scores as the parent once did. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="box-2">
                <p>All parents love to see their child exceed in sport, school or even socially, but it's not that common that a child be the absolute best in the field. Parents strive for their child to excel and be the highest achiever in all fields sport, art, music, and school and socially but this isn't possible. 
                The joy a child receives from their favourite activity should reflect success. It is human nature to want to excel, an individual puts that pressure on themselves alone, the extra pressure from a parent isn't needed as well. 
                Parent pressure is something that parents always notice other parents doing but never notice that they are doing it themselves. It isn't the coach or teachers problem to look after the well-being of your child, it is the parents. 
                Often children think they are pressured by their parents the most in regards to sport, especially in Australia as it is a very sports-related country. </p>
